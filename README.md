# Tailwind CSS Directive Errors

This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using Tailwind CSS directives and offers solutions.

## Bug Description:
Incorrect usage of Tailwind directives can lead to styling issues such as unexpected styles, missing styles, or conflicts with existing CSS. This frequently happens due to typos in class names, misuse of modifiers (e.g., `hover`, `focus`), or conflicts between Tailwind classes.

## How to reproduce:
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.js` to view the example code with incorrect Tailwind directives.
3.  Observe the styling issues in the rendered output.

## Solution:
Refer to `bugSolution.js` for corrected code. The solution focuses on fixing typos, correctly applying directives, and avoiding naming conflicts.

## Lessons Learned:

*   Pay close attention to class name spelling and syntax.
*   Thoroughly test your Tailwind classes to ensure they're applied correctly.
*   Use Tailwind's developer tools or browser extensions to inspect your CSS and identify conflicts.
